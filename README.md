# Big-Data-Technologies - University Ranking

Project run by Patrick Montanari and Davide Longo, carried as an exercise for the class of Big Data Technologies as a part of our Master's Degree in Data Science.

The main goal is to provide a mean through which any user can have access to rankings of all italian universities for a given year, visualized through a front-end application and corresponding interactive interface.
